# cc3k

## Description
We made ChamberCrawler3000 (CC3k), which is a rogue-like game (role-playing game where the player dungeon crawls through 5 levels to win) <br />

The player moves through the dungeon and slays enemies while collecting trasure (and potions!) until reaching the end of the 5th floor. Additionally the player can buy potions from the merchant shop.

## Dungeon floor
Floors are randomly generated

unfortunately, due to policy 71, we cannot directly put our code here, but we have a demo.pdf :)
